# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use

to write your content.


## Install

Install these first:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade setuptools build twine
```

## Create (Test) PyPI Account Token

```
$HOME/.pypirc

[testpypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-xxxxx

```

## Generate distribution archive

From the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file run:

```
python3 -m build
```

The tar.gz file is a source distribution whereas the .whl file is a built distribution.

```
pycowsay_tutorial/dist/
├── pycowsay_tutorial-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
└── pycowsay_tutorial-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
## Upload the distribution archive

```
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

## Create Entry Points

Now, suppose that we would like to provide some way of executing the function hello_world() from the command-line. 

One way to do this is to create a file `src/pycowsay/__main__.py` providing a hook as follows:

```
from . import hello_world

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello_world()
```
Better though is:

```
pyproject.toml

[project.scripts]
cowsay = "timmins:hello_world"
```
